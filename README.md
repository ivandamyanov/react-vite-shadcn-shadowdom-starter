# Shadow DOM support modifications on top of React + Vite + TypeScript Template (react-vite-ui)
- main.tsx creates a shadow root (closed mode, change to open if you need to) and includes tailwind styles using `globals.css?inline` syntax
- src/styles/globals.css includes :host selector to support ShadowDOM styling and has re-declared variables as in [this github discussion](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/15556)
- ShadowRoot context wrapper for <App/> and `useShadowRoot` hook
- DialogContent component in dialog.tsx patched to pass ShadowRoot to `DialogPortal` container prop - this also fixes the Command component and even if you don't use these shadcn components, this approach might help you fix other ones you might add later by using a portal to render the component inside the shadow DOM instead of the body as default for some use cases.
- Updated to latest npm packages using `ncu -u` command (i use this tool everywhere - `npm install -g npm-check-updates` and type `ncu` to check for changes without applying them)
- Command component list was not scrolling (not related to shadow DOM), after reading [this discussion](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/542) I updated DialogPrimitive.Content in dialog.tsx to add `onWheel` and `onTouchMove` handling to fix the issue.
- No other modifications to default template

- THEME - to apply dark theme using the 'dark' class, I removed it from the <html> element as it is outside the ShadoW DOM and you can add it to the <main> element instead

- Known issue - console error (no render issues) due to missing DialogTitle because of shadcn's known bug
